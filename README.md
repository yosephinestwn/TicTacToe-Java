# TicTacToe-Java
First Project: TicTacToe

Hello! I am Yosephine and this is my very first project in GitHub: The TicTacToe Game in Java :) 

I am using Java GUI for this project and in this README file you can find the details about this game :)

## Tutorial
1. Run the main method / class
2. Click the "New Game" button to start a new game
3. Choose with which icon you want to play, like the traditional TicTacToe, you can choose one of the two icons (the Icon 'X' and 'O')
4. Then, you get to choose your opponent's mode:

   4.1. If you have a friend to play with, choose the first option

   4.2. You can choose one of the three other options if you want to play alone
   
   4.3. In the "Normal Player" mode, in each of the opponent's turn, your opponent has 50% chance to take a step like a "Random Player"
        and 50% chance like a "Perfect Player"
   
   4.4. In the "Random Player" mode, in each of the opponent's turn, the opponent will randomly put their icon in an empty field
   
   4.5. In the "Perfect Player" mode, in each of the opponent's turn, the opponent will calculate its best move and put their icon there if the field is empty
5. After that, the game will start and you can see whose turn is it on the right side of the window
6. If you have finished the game, you can see 2 options: the first one is to play again and the second one is to exit the game
7. If you choose "Yes", then the game will be reset 
8. If you choose "No", the window will automatically be closed

## Remarks
This game is maybe not perfect, so I hope you can bear with it :) 

If you want to know the details of my code, you can find comments on every method on my codes.
Feel free to give me feedbacks and I hope you can enjoy this game XD
